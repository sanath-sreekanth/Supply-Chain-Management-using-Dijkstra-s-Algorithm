# Supply-Chain-Management-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This tool solves the supply chain problem using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the most optimal and feasible solution to the supply chain problem. 
It considers factors such as distance, time and cost to determine the optimal path for the supply chain. 
It can be customised to fit the specific needs to each factory, allowing for unique workflows and supply chain optimisations.
